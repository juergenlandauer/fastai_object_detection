This package makes some object detection and instance segmentation models available for fastai users by using 
a callback which converts the batches to the required input. 

It comes with a fastai `DataLoader`s class for object detection, prepared and easy to use models and 
some metrics to measure generated bounding boxes (mAP). So you can train a model for object detection 
in the simple fastai way with one of the included learner classes.

## Install
